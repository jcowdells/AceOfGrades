How is a harmonic produced on a string?,When the wavelength aligns so that a node is at each end of the string.,,,3,3
What are the results of the Young double slit experiment?,"The Young double slit experiment shows that light acts as a wave, as it can produce an interference pattern using two coherent light sources. When a sheet is placed in front of the sources, we see how fringes appear where constructive interference results in maxima, and destructive interference results in minima.",,,3,2
How can two coherent sources of waves be created?,"You could use two loudspeakers, as long as they are connected to the same signal generator. Or, by using a single source, and using a double slit to diffract the source into two coherent sources.",,,3,3
Why are points between adjacent nodes in phase?<br>Why are points on either side of a node in antiphase?,"Between two nodes, each point will reach its maximum displacement at the same time, even if that maximum is different. This means that they must be in the same point in the cycle.<br>On opposite sides of a node the reverse is true - one side reaches a maximum when the other side is at a minimum.",,,3,3
How can you use microwaves to demonstrate an interference pattern?,<ul><li>Place a source of microwaves pointing into a double slit with gaps of around 1cm.</li><li>Place a microwave receiver in front of the double slits.</li><li>Connect the receiver to a voltmeter or oscilloscope to read the intensity.</li><li>Use a pencil to mark where the maxima are detected.</li></ul>,,,3,2
How can two waves be not coherent?,Two filament lamps will not produce coherent EM waves - they may have slightly different colours due to differences in quality and material of filaments and such.,,,3,2
What is path difference?,Path difference is the difference in distance that two waves from different sources have to travel in order to reach a common point.,,,3,3
How can interference patterns be demonstrated using sound waves?,"Use two parallel loudspeakers connected to a common signal generator, and move a microphone in a straight line in front of and parallel to the loudspeakers. The microphone should detect areas of high and low intensity where the maxima and minima occur.",,,3,2
Why does the Young double experiment prove light is a wave?,"If light was a beam of particles, then only two bright spots would appear. Yet, we see an interference pattern on the screen.",,,3,3
When is a stationary wave formed?,"A stationary wave is formed when two progressive waves of the same frequency and wavelength, traveling in opposite direction are superposed.",,,3,2
What is the Young double split experiment?,"It is an experiment to show how light behaves as a wave. It works using a filament lamp and a colour filter behind a double slit, which diffracts light into two coherent sources that can interfere.",,,3,3
How can stationary waves be produced with a microwave transmitter?,"By firing a microwave transmitter at a metal sheet, the reflected microwaves will superpose against the new waves, forming a stationary wave.",,,3,2
What is coherence?,Coherence is when two waves from different sources have a constant phase difference.,,,3,3
What is the fundamental frequency?,The frequency of a wave that produces a stationary wave when the wavelength is as large as possible.,,,3,3
How is a harmonic formed in a tube of air open at one end?,"When there is a node at the closed end, and an antinode at the open end.",,,3,3
What is a stationary wave?,"A wave that remains in a constant position with no net transfer of energy, characterised by its nodes and antinodes.",,,3,3
How can you experimentally determine the wavelength of a source of light?,"<ul><li>Place a source of light (e.g. laser) behind a double slit.</li><li>Place a sheet a good distance in front of the light source, such as 40cm. Measure this distance with a meter rule.</li><li>Measure the distance between adjacent maxima using a smaller ruler e.g. 30cm.</li><li>For better precision, measure the distance between 10 maxima, and divide by 9 (makes sense, measuring between 2 maxima gives only 1 separation).</li><li>Move the light source back by 10cm.</li><li>Repeat measurements, and keep incrementing distance.</li><li>λ = ax/D ==> x = Dλ/a</li><li>Plot a graph of fringe separation against distance to sheet.</li><li>Gradient should equal to wavelength / slit separation.</li><li>Wavelength = gradient * slit separation.</li><li>Slit separation is usually printed on double slits.</li></ul>",,,3,2
What are nodes and antinodes on a stationary wave?<br>What is the distance between adjacent nodes in terms of λ?,"<ul><li>Nodes are points where the displacement is 0, antinodes are points where the displacement reaches a maximum amplitude.</li><li>The distance between two adjacent nodes is λ/2.</li></ul>",,,3,3
What is meant by the principle of superposition for waves?,"When two or more waves meet at a point, the resultant displacement will equal the sum of their displacements.",,,3,2
How are intensity and amplitude related?,Intensity ∝ (Amplitude)²,,,3,3
How are harmonics formed in a tube that is open at both ends?,There will be an antinode at each end of the tube.,,,3,3
How can the speed of sound be determined using harmonics in a tube of air?,"<ul><li>Mark a tube with measurements, for example every centimetre.</li><li>Place the tube in a tank of water deep enough to submerge it.</li><li>Using tuning forks of a known frequency, strike the fork and hold it above the tube.</li><li>Note the smallest legnth of tube where a loud sound is heard being emitted.</li><li>Repeat for several tuning forks.</li><li>v = fλ, L = λ/4 (first harmonic) ==> v = 4fL, or L = v/4f</li><li>Plot a graph of tube length against 1/frequency</li><li>Measuring the gradient will give v/4, so 4 * gradient = speed of sound.</li></ul>",,,3,3
What conditions are needed to form an interference pattern?,"The waves must be coherent, and of the same type e.g. both EM waves.",,,3,3
What are the conditions for constructive interference?<br>What are the conditions for destructive interference?,"<ul><li>Constructive - 0 or whole number of λ, 0 or even number of π.</li><li>Destructive - (2n + 1)/2 λ, (2n + 1)π, n ε Z+</li></ul>",,,3,3
What is constructive and destructive interference?,"Constructive interference is when two waves meet in phase, and the peaks are aligned to increase amplitude.<br>Destructive interference is when two waves meet in antiphase, and each peak meets a trough, reducing the amplitude.",,,3,2
