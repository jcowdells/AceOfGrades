What is the difference between passive RFID and active RFID?,"<ul><li>Passive RFID requires an external radio signal to be emitted from a reader. The signal induces a current in the transponder, which transmits a stored code.</li><li>Active RFID contains a power source which constantly powers the transponder. The stored code is always being transmitted, meaning that the RFID device does not need to be close to the receiver to be detected.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using active RFID instead of passive RFID?,"Advantages:<br><ol><li>Can be received from further away.</li><li>Does not need to physically touch a reader to be detected.</li><li>A reader can simultaneously detect several active RFID devices.</li></ol><br>Disadvantages:<br><ol><li>Has a limited battery life and can run out of charge.</li><li>More complex design, more parts needed (more cost, less reliable)</li><li>Less secure.</li></ol>",,,1,1
What are some of the reasons that an RFID device/system could be chosen for use?,"<ul><li>Small, lightweight device (e.g. can fit in a card)</li><li>Cheap to set up and use.</li><li>Durable.</li><li>(for passive RFID) Powerless/no batteries.</li><li>Quick for a computer to read.</li><li>Has a (small) internal storage.</li><li>Has contactless access.</li></ul>",,,0,0
"What is a barcode, and what are some of its features?","A barcode is a printed diagram of light and dark strips, containing some information.<br>They have three ""guard bars"" mark the start, middle and end of the barcode.<br>Barcodes also typically have a checksum/parity bit to detect for errors while reading.",,,0,0
What are the two different formats of barcodes? Why is one form rarely used?,Barcodes can either be 1D (a series of lines) or 2D (a grid of rectangles).<br>QR codes are normally used in place of 2D barcodes.,,,0,0
How does a barcode reader work?,"<ul><li>Emits light out of the reader towards the barcode.</li><li>Light reflects into a mirror -> sensor receives the reflected light.</li><li>Reflected light is converted to an electrical signal by the sensor.</li><li>ADC converter decodes the signal into a binary representation, which can be used by computers.</li></ul>",,,0,0
What are some properties of barcodes/barcode scanners that would need to be considered when deciding whether to use them?,<ul><li>Fast to scan (scans 1000s of times per second).</li><li>Affordable (uses printed stickers).</li><li>Requires a direct line of sight to the barcode to read it.</li><li>Barcode stops working if obscured / torn.</li></ul>,,,0,0
What are the steps a digital camera goes through to take a picture?,<ol><li>Shutter will open for a short period of time.</li><li>Lens will focus light that enters camera onto the sensor.</li><li>Sensor will convert received light into a series of electrical signals based on brightness.</li><li>ADC converts electrical signal into binary.</li><li>Grouped into RGB arrays to represent as a bitmap image.</li></ol>,,,0,0
What are the two types of sensors in digital cameras?,"<ul><li>CMOS - complementary metal oxide semiconductor (modern, found in 99% of cameras)</li><li>CCD - charge coupled device (old, found in outdated cameras and in specialised equipment)</li></ul>",,,0,0
How are camera sensors set up?,"<ul><li>Array/grid of light sensors, one for each pixel in the image.</li><li>Light filter in front of each sensor - Bayer filter. Ensures each sensor only gets either red, green or blue light.</li><li>A Bayer filter has 2x as many green pixels as red or blue pixels, as this mimics how human eyes are more sensitive to green light.</li></ul>",,,0,0
