What is quantitative data?<br>What is qualitative data?,"<ul><li>Quantitative data is numeric data that can be measured.</li><li>Qualitative data is descriptive data that is meant to understand experiences, opinions and characteristics.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a mean?,"<ul><li>Takes all values into account, and allows for further calculation of s.d.</li><li>However, you must know all the data, and is easily skewed by outliers.</li></ul>",,,1,1
How do you estimate the mean and standard deviation of grouped data?,You need to take the midpoint of each group and multiply by the frequency. Use this to find your mean and sums of squares. Then use s.d. formula.,,,1,1
For a systematic random sample:<ul><li>What is it?</li><li>What are the advantages?</li><li>What are the disadvantages?</li><li>Is it random?</li><li>Does each participant have an equal chance?</li></ul>,"<ul><li>For a sample of n of population m, calculate m/n, select random number 1 to m/n, then choose every m/nth person thereafter.</li><li>Easy to perform on a list of names. Random enough to be effective.</li><li>Can be skewed if data follows a pattern matching the sequence of the chosen data. (unlikely)</li><li>It is not random, as not every combination of people is possible.</li><li>Each participant has an equal chance, if each ""group"" is the same size.</li></ul>",,,1,1
How do you know when a binomial distribution can be approximated as a normal?,"For a binomial B(n, p), can be approximated as N(np, sqrt(np(1-p)) when np >= 5 and n(1-p) >= 5.",,,0,0

For an opportunity sample:<ul><li>What is it?</li><li>What are the advantages?</li><li>What are the disadvantages?</li><li>Is it random?</li><li>Does each participant have an equal chance?</li></ul>,"<ul><li>Pick the first X people you come across and ask them.</li><li>Ridonculously easy.</li><li>Absolutely going to have bias, not representative.</li><li>Not random.</li><li>Not an equal chance.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a mode?,"<ul><li>Easy to calculate, and works with non-numeric data.</li><li>However, may not be unique, and may not exist. May also be unrepresentative for data with a wide range or if it is 0.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What are the advantages and disadvantages of a median?,"<ul><li>Good for when there are outliers, and can be found if some data is missing.</li><li>However, it is difficult to estimate for grouped data.</li></ul>",,,1,0
For a simple random sample:<ul><li>What is it?</li><li>What are the advantages?</li><li>What are the disadvantages?</li><li>Is it random?</li><li>Does each participant have an equal chance?</li></ul>,"<ul><li>Number participants, use random number generator, select corresponding.</li><li>Simple and easy. Representative.</li><li>Can be time consuming to do, and could mean different strata are unluckily excluded.</li><li>It is random.</li><li>Each participant is equally likely.</li></ul>",,,1,1
For a cluster sample:<ul><li>What is it?</li><li>What are the advantages?</li><li>What are the disadvantages?</li><li>Is it random?</li><li>Does each participant have an equal chance?</li></ul>,"<ul><li>Divide population into geographic (or other) clusters that make them easier to sample. Then sample some of the clusters.</li><li>Can save time by making it easier to sample (e.g. sampling two locations of a store instead of all 1000 stores)</li><li>Not representative of population, may be that the cluster was an outlier, people in that cluster have similar views etc.</li><li>Not random, not all combinations are possible.</li><li>People in smaller clusters have better odds (if clusters have same size, each is equally likely)</li></ul>",,,1,1
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a range?,"<ul><li>Easy to calculate</li><li>However, depends only on extreme values, not appropriate for large data sets, and cannot be calculated if unknown values.<li></ul>",,,1,1
For a stratified random sample:<ul><li>What is it?</li><li>What are the advantages?</li><li>What are the disadvantages?</li><li>Is it random?</li><li>Does each participant have an equal chance?</li></ul>,"<ul><li>Divide population into different strata, then sample each group individually with a sample size proportionate to the stratum size.</li><li>It allows you to compare between strata, as each is represented fairly.</li><li>Requires prior knowledge of the population, and is more complex.</li><li>It is not random, not every combination is possible.</li><li>Each participant should still have an equal chance.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What % of a normal curve is within:<ul><li>1 sd of mean?</li><li>2 sd of mean?</li><li>3 sd of mean?</li></ul>,<ul><li>68% within 1sd.</li><li>95% within 2sd.</li><li>99.7% within 3sd.</li></ul>,,,1,1
For a quota sample:<ul><li>What is it?</li><li>What are the advantages?</li><li>What are the disadvantages?</li><li>Is it random?</li><li>Does each participant have an equal chance?</li></ul>,"<ul><li>Go around and find the first X people that fit this category, the firsts Y people that fit that category, etc.</li><li>Very easy to carry out. Representative of strata without knowing about the population.</li><li>Biased to people who are likely to be chosen for that situation.</li><li>Not random.</li><li>Not all participants have the same chance of being selected.</li></ul>",,,1,1
