What is thinking distance?,Thinking distance is the distance traveled by a vehicle from the instant that a driver realises a hazard to the instant that they apply the brakes.,,,2,2
What steps could you take to find the motion of an object fired upwards at an angle?,"<ul><li>Find the components of the vector, Ux = UcosA, Uy = UsinA.</li><li>Use the vertical component to find the air time, solving for when displacement = original height. You should get two times, 0 and T.</li><li>Ux * T will give the horizontal distance traveled.</li><li>Solving for when Vy = 0 gives the maximum height reached.</li></ul>",,,2,2
What is stopping distance?,"Stopping distance is the sum of thinking distance and braking distance, or in other words the distance traveled from the instant a driver realises a hazard, and the instant that their vehicle comes to a stop.",,,2,2
What is the difference between distance and displacement?,"Distance is a scalar quantity that measures how far something has traveled. Displacement is a vector quantity that measures both how far something has traveled, and also in which direction.",,,2,2
What three experiments can be done to find the value of g?,"<ol><li>A steel ball is attached to an electromagnet, which is a measured distance above a trapdoor. A timer starts when the ball is released from the magnet, and stops when the ball hits the trapdoor.</li><li>A ball is dropped from rest through two light gates which are a known distance apart. The light gates measure the time to travel between gates and the instantaneous speed at each.</li><li>A small metal ball is dropped from rest, and many pictures are taken at regular intervals with the ball near a meter rule. Pictures are examined to determine distance and time between each instant.</li></ol>",,,2,2
Under which conditions to the suvat equations work?,"The suvat equations will only work for scenarios that have a constant acceleration, and where the motion occurs in a straight line (or for projectiles, can be split into two perpendicular motions which are straight).",,,2,2
What is instantaneous velocity? How is it found on a graph?,"The velocity of an object at a particular moment in time. It is found by drawing a tangent to a displacement-time graph, or by reading off a velocity-time graph.",,,2,2
Do you know the suvat equations?,Yes.,,,2,2
What is braking distance?,"Braking distance is the distance traveled by a vehicle between the instant that the braking force is applied, and the instant when the car comes to a complete stop.",,,2,2
