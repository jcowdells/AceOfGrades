Explain how a bubble sort can sort a list.,"<ul><li>Compare the first two items in the list.</li><li>If they are in the wrong order then swap them.</li><li>Move to the next pair of items.</li><li>Repeat until the end of the list is reached, this will be the first pass.</li><li>Make a second pass through the list for one less iteration, as the last item is now in order.</li><li>Once a pass is made with no swaps, the list is sorted.</li></ul>",,,0,0
Explain how a breadth-first traversal is used to traverse a graph.,"<ul><li>From start node, add all neighbours to a visited queue, and mark start node as discovered.</li><li>Dequeue neighbour queue, mark that node as discovered, and add its unvisited/undiscovered neighbours to the queue.</li><li>Effectively, traverse all of the children of one node before going down to their children.</li><li>Continue until the queue becomes empty, at which point graph is fully traversed.</li></ul>",,,0,0
