How can an object in circular motion traveling at a constant speed be accelerating?,"An object in circular motion at constant speed is accelerating because acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Although the speed stays the same, the direction of the velocity is continuously changing. Since velocity is a vector, a change in direction means the velocity is changing, so the object must be accelerating *towards the centre of the circle* (centripetal acceleration).",,,1,0
What is the definition of angular velocity? What are the equations for angular velocity?,Angular velocity is defined for an object in circular motion as the rate of change of angle.<br>Equations for angular velocity:<br><ul><li>ω = θ / T</li><li>ω = θf</li><li>ω = v / r</li></ul>,,,1,1
What is the difference between angular velocity and tangential velocity?,"Angular velocity is the rate of change of angle, measured in radians per second.<br>Tangential velocity is the linear speed of the object along the circumference of the circle, measured in m/s.<br>They are linked by the equation v=ωr.",,,1,1
How do you solve problems involving conical pendulums?,"A conical pendulum will have a tension and a weight force acting on the hung mass. The vertical component of tension Tcosθ will be equal to the weight in order to stop physics bugging out. Tsinθ will be equal to the centripetal force holding the circular shape. Then, you can also do Tsinθ / Tcosθ to find tanθ and do alternate buggerings with that value. (finding θ probably)",,,1,1
What is centripetal force?,"Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration experienced in the direction of the centre of rotation, always perpendicular to the direction of motion.",,,1,0
How can cars drive around a banked track faster than a flat track?,"<ul><li>Circular motion requires a centripetal force pointing towards the centre of rotation.</li><li>On a flat track, all of this force must come from friction between the tyres and the track. However, banking the track means a component of the normal contact force can make up the centripetal force.</li><li>Looking at the equation for centripetal force: F = mv² / r, F is proportional to v², so increasing the centripetal force will increase the maximum possible velocity.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What is centrifugal force?,An easy way to lose a bunch of marks. Pls say centripetal force.,,,1,1
What is the definition of tangential velocity? What are the equations for tangential velocity?,The tangential velocity is a measure of the linear speed of an object in circular motion at a particular instant.<br>Equations for it:<br><ul><li>v = 2πr / T</li><li>v = 2πrf</li></ul>,,,1,1
What are the equations for centripetal acceleration?,a = v² / r<br>a = ω²r,,,1,1
"For an object being swung around in a vertical circle, what is the minimum tangential velocity at the highest point of the rotation to maintain a circular trajectory?","<ul><li>a = v² / r.</li><li>The object will always experience a downwards acceleration of g, so it is not possible to have a smaller centripetal acceleration.</li><li>g = v² / r<br>v² = gr<br>v = sqrt(gr) // smallest possible speed.<br>At this speed, the tension in the string (or other holding force) will be 0, as the weight is doing all the work.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What experiment can you carry out to investigate circular motion?,"<ul><li>Attach a bung to a string and thread the string through a tube. Add a mass to the other end of the string that's hanging through the string. </li><li>Place a marker at some point on the string that you can maintain in a certain position, and record the length of string emerging from the top of the tube at this point.</li><li>Spin the bung around by holding the tube and use a timer to record the time taken for 10 spins, and divide this time by 10 to get a time period T.</li><li>Increase the mass by 100g and repeat the experiment.</li><li>Calculate the linear velocity v by the calculation v = 2πr / T.</li><li>F = Mg = mv²/r, rearranging to give M = v² * m / gr.</li><li>Plot a graph of M against v², should find a straight line through the origin where the gradient = m / gr.</li></ul>",,,1,1
Why does circular motion only have constant speed when the centripetal force is perpendicular to the velocity?,"If not perpendicular, then looking at W = Fd, the distance parallel to the force is not zero, hence work is done and converted to kinetic energy, hence not constant speed.",,,0,0
