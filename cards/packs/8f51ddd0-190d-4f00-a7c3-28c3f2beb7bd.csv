What is the hidden node problem?<br>How can it be overcome?,"In a wireless network, each device has a maximum range for devices it can ""see"". This means if two devices are on opposite sides of a wireless access point, they could feasibly be in range of the access point, but not each other, hence there is a hidden node on the network. This is problematic because the nodes could attempt to communicate on the same frequency and corrupt each other's data.<br>To overcome this, you can employ collision avoidance. Each node at random intervals will broadcast a Request To Send (RTS) packet, and the wireless access point will respond to a node with a Clear To Send (CTS) packet.
