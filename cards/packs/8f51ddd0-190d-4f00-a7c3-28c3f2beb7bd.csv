What is the difference between lossy and lossless compression?,"Lossless compression retains all of the data in the original file, by rearranging and storing the data in a more efficient way.Lossy compression removes data that is deemed unnecessary in order to reduce the file size, meaning the original file cannot be reconstructed.",,,3,3

What is MIDI?,Musical Instrument Digital Interface,,,3,3
What is a Caesar Cipher?,A substitution cipher where each character of text is shifted by a fixed number of characters up the alphabet.,,,3,3
What is 'Majority Voting'?,"A method of checking binary data for errors by sending each bit multiple times, in a set. The receiver takes the value with the most occurrences in a set as the value for that bit.",,,3,3
What is Unicode? Why was it created?,"Unicode was created as another way of encoding characters. It comes in forms such as UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32, with the number denoting the number of bits per character. Unicode was created to replace ASCII, which only has 95 symbols, as it allows other languages to be represented. Unicode allows for many billions of characters to be supported, allowing foreign languages such as Mandarin and Japanese.",,,2,2
How do you convert from analogue to digital and vice versa?,"<ul><li>Use an analogue to digital converter (ADC) to convert continuous analogue signals into digital.</li><li>Use a digital to analogue converter (DAC) to convert digital signals into continuous analogue signals, by guesstimating between digital values.</li></ul>",,,3,3
What is a Vernam Cipher?,"A cipher that uses a one-time pad with the same length as the message. A one time pad should be:- never re-used- disposed of securely- be truly random- transferred securely, independently of the messageEach character is XORed with the corresponding character in the one-time pad. Then, you can XOR the ciphertext with the one-time pad to get back the plaintext.",,,3,3

What is the difference between passive RFID and active RFID?,"<ul><li>Passive RFID requires an external radio signal to be emitted from a reader. The signal induces a current in the transponder, which transmits a stored code.</li><li>Active RFID contains a power source which constantly powers the transponder.
