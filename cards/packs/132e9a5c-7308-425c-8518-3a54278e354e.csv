What is a uniform electric field and how can you create one?,"Two oppositely charged plates will produce a uniform electric field between them, with the lines pointing from the positive to the negative plate.",,,2,1
What is the definition of electric potential difference?,It is the difference in electrical potential between two points in an electric field.,,,2,2
What is Coulomb's law?,Coulomb’s law states that any two point charges exert an electrostatic force between themthat is proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the squareof the distance between them.,,,2,2
What does it mean to have a negative force?,"A negative force represents an attraction, a positive force represents a repulsion.",,,2,2
What can be used to detect an electric field?,"A thin piece of gold foil can be used to detect an electric field. By charging the foil with a positive charge, it will be repelled in the direction of the field lines, and the amount of repulsion reveals the strength of the electric field.",,,2,2
What is the definition of electrical potential?,The work done per unit positive charge in bringing that charge from infinity to a point in an electric field.,,,2,2
What is electric field strength and what is the equation for it?,"The electric field strength is the force experienced per unit positive charge at a point in an electric field.<br>The equation is F = EQ, force = field strength * charge.<br>Rearrange to get E = F / Q",,,2,1
What are the rules of drawing electric field lines?,<ol><li>The arrows point in the direction of force on a positively charged object in the field.</li><li>The lines should always be parallel to the surface of an object.</li><li>The field lines cannot cross over at any point.</li><li>The distance between adjacent lines represents the field strength at that point.</li></ol>,,,2,2
What is the equation for a uniform electric field?,E = V / d<br>Field Strength = Voltage / Distance (between plates),,,2,2
What is the equation for Coulomb's law?,F = Qq / 4πε₀r²<br>Force = charge_1 * charge_2 / (4 * pi * epsilon_nought * radius * radius),,,2,2
What is the definition of an electric field?,An electric field is a region of space where a charged object will experience a force at a distance.,,,2,2
What apparatus can be used to investigate Coulomb's law?,"<ul><li>Hang one ball from a stand using an insulating material, and support another ball using an insulating rod which is placed on a mass balance.</li><li>Charge the balls using a positive electrode.</li></li>By moving the suspended ball closer to the supported ball, the mass balance should register an increase in ""mass"" as the normal reaction force increases to accommodate the increased electrostatic force due to Coulomb's law.</li></ul>",,,2,0
What is the equation for electric potential energy?,W = Qq / 4πε₀r,,,2,2
Where does the equation for electric potential energy come from?,"Coulomb's law tells us the force between two charges. You can plot a graph of this force against the distance between charges - a 1/x² relationship. W = Fd, so the area under this graph tells us the work done. Integrating the graph from r to infinity gives us the 1/x relationship that the equation for electrical potential energy has.",,,2,2
What is the equation for electric field strength?,E = Q / 4πε₀r²<br>If you remember Coulomb's law and the equation F = EQ then you can quite easily rediscover it anyway.,,,2,2
What is the equation for electric potential?,V = Q / 4πε₀r<br>Potential = Charge / (4 * pi * epsilon nought * distance),,,2,1
