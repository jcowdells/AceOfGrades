How do you calculate the threshold frequency of light for a material?,"hf = Φ + KEmax. When KEmax is 0, photons have the minimum energy needed to release photoelectrons. Therefore hf = Φ at the threshold frequency, so f = Φ / h.",,,6,5
How can you experimentally determine the Planck constant?,"<ul><li>Connect an LED with known wavelength of light being emitted to a circuit consisting of an ammeter in series, and a voltmeter in parallel to the LED. Also use a resistor to reduce the voltage further of the LED, making it easier to adjust. Use a potentiometer in parallel to the LED to vary the voltage across it.</li><li>Darken the room using window covers, turn off lights, and use a small tube of black card to shield the LED.</li><li>Place your eye at the end of the tube, and vary the potentiometer until you are at the point where light is barely visible, and reducing the voltage at all will turn off the LED.</li><li>Swap the LED with a different colour one and repeat the experiment with a range of wavelengths.</li><li>At the threshold p.d., exactly one electron uses all its energy to emit one photon. So use eV = hc/λ</li><li>Rearrange to give V = 1/λ * hc/e, where V, 1/λ are variables, hc/e is a constant or gradient.</li><li>Now plot a graph of threshold p.d. against 1/wavelength, and measure the gradient of the line of best fit. Then, multiply by c/e and you will find an experimental value of the Planck constant.</li></ul>",,,6,4
What is the de Broglie equation?,λ = h/mv - It is an equation which links anything with mass to the wavelength of a wave traveling at the speed of light.,,,3,2
What is a photon?,A photon is a quantum of electromagnetic energy.,,,6,5
When do we see electrons behaving as particles?,"In an electron gun, electrons can be accelerated by the accelerating p.d., suggesting they have a mass - e.g. they are matter/particles.",,,6,3
When do we see electrons behave as waves?<br>Why is this not seen normally?,"If a beam of electrons is fired at a thin sheet of polycrystalline graphite, the electrons are seen to diffract around the space between carbon atoms, exhibiting a wave-like behaviour.<br>We don't normally see this, as there are few materials where the electrons have a small enough gap to diffract.",,,6,4
What is an electroscope and how can it be used to demonstrate the photoelectric effect?,"An electroscope is a device that measures the strength of electric charges. It can demonstrate the photoelectric effect by charging the electroscope with a cloth or Van de Graaff generator etc, causing the gold leaf in the electroscope to gain electrons and be repelled. Then, by shining a UV light onto the electroscope, the electroscope will emit photoelectrons, losing its charge and falling back down.",,,6,6
How would the IV characteristic of a red LED differ from a blue LED?,"For a red LED, there would be an x-intercept representing the threshold p.d preceded by a flat line (diode behaviour), and then an exponential increase in current after that. For the blue LED, the shape will be similar, except the x-intercept / threshold p.d. would be higher.",,,6,5
What is the Planck equation?,"E = hf = hc/λ<br>It is an equation that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency, and therefore to its wavelength.",,,3,3
What are the three key observations from the photoelectric effect experiment?,"<ol><li>Photoelectrons are only emitted when light is above a certain 'threshold frequency'.<li>Above the threshold frequency, the emission of photoelectrons is instantaneous, (e.g. they don't build up energy over time, it happens in a single action)</li><li>The intensity of light does not effect the kinetic energy of electrons emitted, only the number of them.</li></ol>",,,6,4
How can we demonstrate the wave-like properties of electrons experimentally?,"<ul><li>Using an electron gun inside a vacuum tube, fire a beam of electrons at a thin piece of polycrystalline graphite.</li><li>The gaps between carbon atoms in the graphite is similar to the de Broglie wavelength of electrons, meaning that they will diffract.</li><li>The electrons will interfere at the other side of the graphite, due to them behaving as waves.</li><li>This means the electrons can interfere, and will cause an interference pattern on the fluorescent screen.</li></ul>",,,6,5
"Why does Einstein's photoelectric equation have a maximum kinetic energy, not just a kinetic energy?","The equation is hf = Φ + KEmax, where Φ is the work function / minimum energy requirement to emit a photoelectron. This means that the amount of energy will be greater than or equal to Φ, meaning that KEmax is when Φ is at a miniumum, and can only become smaller to conserve energy if more than Φ energy is needed to emit a photoelectron.",,,6,4
How can you graphically represent the photoelectric equation to find the work function and the Planck constant?,"<ul><li>hf = Φ + KEmax</li><li>rearrange for KEmax = hf - Φ</li><li>Plot a graph of KEmax on y-axis, and frequency on the x-axis.</li><li>The gradient will equal the Planck constant, the y-intercept will be the negative of work function</li></ul>",,,6,6
What is the threshold voltage of an LED?,"It is the minimum voltage at which light is emitted from the LED. At this voltage, the resistance is low enough to allow current to flow through the diode.",,,6,6
"What is the relationship between the threshold voltage of an LED, and the frequency of the photons emitted?","When the LED is at the threshold voltage, and light is only just emitted the energy input of the LED = the energy output of the LED.<br>E = VQ<br>E = hf<br>VQ = hf",,,6,4
"What is the Planck constant, and what is its value?",The Planck constant is a fundamental constant in physics that relates the energy of a photon to it's frequency. It has a value of 6.63e-34.,,,6,4
What is the work function?<br>What is the threshold frequency?<br>,The work function is the minimum amount of energy required to emit a single photoelectron from the surface of a material.<br>The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of a photon that would mean it would have enough energy to equal or surpass the work function of a material.,,,6,5
What is meant by the wave-particle duality?,The wave-particle duality is the observation that electromagnetic radiation and matter both exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties.,,,6,5
What is the photoelectric effect?,The photoelectric effect is when a photon of sufficient frequency incident at the surface of a metal causes the emission of a single photoelectron. This effect provides evidence for the particulate nature of light.,,,6,4
What is a photoelectron?,An electron that has been released from a material due receiving a photon of light.,,,6,5
