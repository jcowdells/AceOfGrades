"How would you write the entity description for a Customer entity, with an ID, name, address and email?","Don't forget to underline primary key.<br>Customer(CustomerID, CustomerName, CustomerAddress, CustomerEmail)",,,7,7
What is second normal form of a database?,"In second normal form, the database satisfies first normal form. Additionally, partial key dependencies are removed - the database is split so that the data is only dependent on the key. If you had an entity Student(StudentID, StudentName, StudentSubject, SubjectExamDate), then StudentExamDate is only dependent on StudentSubject, not on StudentID. Therefore Subject and ExamDate should be in their own table.",,,6,4
What is commitment ordering?,Commitment ordering is needed to allow record locking to work. It is a process that decides the most efficient order to apply transactions that will cause the least amount of record locks.,,,5,3
What are the kinds of errors that can occur when using a database that is not normalised?,"<ul><li>Insertion anomaly - when data is added to a table that doesn't make sense, e.g. using a foreign key that points to non-existent data.</li><li>Update anomaly - when data is duplicated across records, and one is updated without changing the other, causing inconsistencies.</li><li>Deletion anomaly - when deleting a record causes other parts of the table that referenced that record via foreign key to stop working.</li></ul>",,,3,1
What is a client server database?,A database that provides simultaneous access to the database for multiple clients.,,,5,4
What are entity relationship diagrams?,"Entity relationship diagrams are used to graphically represent the relationships between entities in a relational database. The possible relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many. They are represented by a straight line to symbol one, or by 3 lines to symbol many.",,,6,6
What is meant by concurrent access in a database system?,Allowing two or more users to access information from the database while retaining data integrity.,,,5,2
What features does a fully normalised database have?,<ul><li>Data is atomic with no repeating attributes.</li><li>There are no partial key dependencies.</li><li>There are no non-key dependencies.</li></ul>,,,3,2
What is the first normal form of a database?,"In first normal form, the database:<br><ul><li>Contains no repeating attributes</li><li>The stored data is atomic (cannot be split any further)</li></ul><br>For example, if a school database had ""Science, Maths"" as subjects listed for a teacher, this should be split into two different entries for each subject.",,,6,4
What makes a relational database different from a flat file database?,"A relational database has relations instead of tables. Each table represents a single entity, and relationships between entities are represented by foreign keys.",,,6,5
What is a data model?,A data model is an abstract model for organising data and its relationship to real world entities.,,,6,3
What is record locking?,Record locking is a technique to prevent simultaneous access to a database by locking a record while it is being updated.,,,5,4
What is an entity identifier?,"An entity identifier is the attribute or attributes of an entity that can be used to uniquely identify any entity in the relation. It can either be a primary key, or a composite primary key.",,,6,5
What is an attribute of an entity?,A characteristic specification that defines a property or feature about an entity stored in a database.,,,6,4
What is serialisation (for database concurrent access)?,The process of deciding which transactions can be run in parallel or not (serial = not parallel). This can be achieved by 'record locking' or by 'timestamp ordering'.,,,5,3
What is timestamp ordering?,"Timestamp ordering involves storing the last read and last write timestamps for each record. Any subsequent read requests must be newer than the last write, and any write requests must be newer than the last read request.",,,5,5
What are the advantages of using a relational database over a flat-file database?,<ul><li>Reduces data redundancy.</li><li>Reduces data repetition.</li><li>Improves data integrity.</li><li>Reduces the amount of unnecessarily duplicated data.</li><li>Data can be queried to find useful information.</li><li>Complex queries can be created to retrieve data easily.</li></ul>,,,0,0
