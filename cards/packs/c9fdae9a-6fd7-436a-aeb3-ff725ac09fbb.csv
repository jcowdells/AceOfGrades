What are some examples of resonance?,"<ul><li>Musical instruments have bodies that resonate with certain notes to increase the loudness. (oscillator = instrument body, driving force = string/reed)</li><li>MRI scanner is a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. (oscillator = hydrogen nuclei in the body, driving force = periodic magnetic field)</li></ul>",,,1,1
What is the definition of simple harmonic motion?,"A common kind of oscillating motion where:<ol><li>Acceleration is directly proportional to the displacement.</li><li>Acceleration is negative / occurs in the opposite direction to the displacement.</li></ol><br>As an equation: ""a ∝ -ω²x""",,,1,1
What is heavy damping?,Heavy damping is when:<ul><li>There is a significant decrease in the amplitude</li><li>The oscillator still completes at least one oscillation</li></ul>,,,1,1
Why is the amplitude of a forced oscillator greatest at the resonant frequency?,"Being at the resonant frequency allows for the maximum possible energy transfer to occur for the oscillator. (e.g. the oscillator is never ""fighting against"" the driving force and losing energy that way)",,,1,1
What is critical damping?,Critical damping is when:<ul><li>The amplitude is dramatically reduced.</li><li>The oscillator cannot complete even a single oscillation.</li></ul>,,,1,1
Why will increasing the amplitude of an oscillator increase the maximum velocity?,"max_v = ωA → max_v ∝ A<br>If ω is constant, then max_v is directly proportional to A, and so will increase if A increases.",,,1,1
What is a key property of simple harmonic oscillators?,"They are isochronous, so the period of oscillation is independent of the amplitude.",,,1,1
What is light damping?,Light damping is when:<ul><li>Period of the oscillation is unchanged (or negligible change)</li><li>There is an *exponential* decrease in amplitude.</li> </ul>,,,1,1
How do you calculate the velocity of an oscillator given its displacement? How do you find the maximum velocity?,<ul><li>v = ±ω√(A² - x²)</li><li>max_v = ωA (max velocity is when x = 0)</li></ul>,,,1,1
How do you find the velocity of an oscillator when given a time and the oscillator's properties?,"v = ωAcos(ωt) or v = -ωAsin(ωt)<br>Use cos if the oscillator starts at displacement 0, and use -sin if the oscillator starts at the amplitude.",,,1,0
How do you find the displacement of an oscillator given its properties and a time?,"x = Acos(ωt) or x = Asin(ωt)<br>cos meaning the time started being tracked when displacement was at a maximum, sin meaning it was 0.<br>A = amplitude, ω = ang. freq.",,,1,1
Define the following:<br><ul><li>Displacement</li><li>Amplitude</li><li>Period</li><li>Angular frequency</li></ul>,<ul><li>Displacement - distance of the oscillator from the equilibrium position</li><li>Amplitude - maximum displacement of the oscillator</li><li>Period - the time taken for the oscillator to complete an entire oscillation</li><li>Angular frequency - the number of oscillations that the oscillator completes per unit time</li></ul>,,,1,1
Why does increasing the angular frequency of an oscillator increase the maximum velocity?,"max_v = ωA → max_v ∝ ω<br>ω = 2πf → ω ∝ f<br>hence max_v ∝ f<br>if f increases, then ω increases, and therefore so will max_v if amplitude is constant.",,,1,1
How do you find the acceleration of an oscillator given a time and oscillator properties?,"a = -ω²Asin(ωt) or a = -ω²Acos(ωt)<br>Use -sin if the oscillator starts at the equilibrium, and use -cos if it starts at the amplitude. You can also see it as the equation<br>a = -ω²x<br>And then plug in your equation for x.",,,1,1
What is the definition of damping?,Damping is an external force that acts on the oscillator that has the effect of reducing the amplitude.,,,1,1
"What is meant by ""forced oscillation""?","A forced oscillation is when a periodic driving force is applied to an oscillator, and the system vibrates at the driving frequency.",,,1,1
Describe the energy changes that take place for a vertical spring oscillating with simple harmonic motion.,"<ul><li>At the lowest point, the elastic potential will be at a maximum, the gravitational potential and kinetic energy will be at a minimum.</li><li>Elastic potential energy is transferred into kinetic energy, which is converted partially into gravitational potential as the oscillator moves upwards.</li><li>At the equilibrium position of the oscillator, the kinetic energy will be at a maximum, and the elastic potential will be at a minimum.</li><li>From this point, kinetic energy is only lost, and transferred into both gravitational and elastic potential energy until kinetic energy is 0.</li><li>When that happens, the oscillator has reached its maximum height and begins to fall down. Gravitational potential energy will be at a maximum, kinetic energy is 0.</li><li>From this point, gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy are both converted into kinetic energy as the oscillator falls back down.</li><li>The oscillator will gain kinetic energy until it reaches the equilibrium point, where the kinetic energy will be at a maximum, and the elastic potential will be 0.</li><li>From here, the rest of the remaining gravitational potential will be converted into kinetic energy, and the kinetic energy will be converted into elastic potential until the kinetic energy is 0.</li><li>At this point, the oscillator has completed an entire oscillation, and the cycle will restart.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What is the result of damping a forced oscillation?,"Damping a forced oscillation will:<ul><li>Reduce the amplitude</li><li>Reduce the frequency where the maximum amplitude will occur</li><li>Graphing a frequency-amplitude graph will reveal a lower, broader peak</li></ul>",,,1,1
What is the definition of resonance?,Resonance is when both:<ul><li>The driving frequency of a forced oscillation is equal to the natural frequency of the oscillator.</li><li>There is a significant increase in the amplitude.</li></ul>,,,1,1
"What is meant by ""natural frequency""?","When an object oscillates without any external forces being applied, it oscillates at its naturalfrequency. It is also defined as the frequency of free oscillation.",,,1,1
"What is meant by a ""free oscillation""?","When a mechanical system is displaced from its equilibrium and oscillates with no external forces, this is called a free oscillation.",,,1,1
What's interesting about the stored energy of a simple harmonic oscillator?,Total energy in the oscillator is always constant.,,,1,1
