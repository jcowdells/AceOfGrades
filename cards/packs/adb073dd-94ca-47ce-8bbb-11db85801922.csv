How do you convert a date to a string in python?,"Use the datetime module.<br>date_string = datetime.strftime(dt, ""%d-%m-%Y"")<br>strftime(datetime, format) is the function needed.",,,3,2
"What is a stack frame, and how is it used alongside a call stack to call subroutines?","<ul><li>A stack frame is a structure that contains the  data needed for individual subroutine calls, which are the return addresses, parameters and local variables.</li><li>When a subroutine is called, a new stack frame for that subroutine is pushed onto the call stack.</li><li>When the subroutine ends, the stack frame is popped, and control returns to the return address.</li></ul>",,,2,2
"What is the relationship between composition and aggregation, and what is the difference?","<ul><li>Both are ""has a"" relationship - when an object contains another object.</li><li>Composition means that contained objects are destroyed with the object, aggregation means that objects exist past the lifetime of their container.</li></ul>",,,2,1
What are the advantages of using a subroutine in a program?,"<ol><li>Subroutines are reusable and reduce repeated code - makes it easier to maintain and update the program</li><li>Subroutines break up code into logical, manageable chunks - makes the program easier to understand</li><li>Individual subroutines can be tested separately - bugs are easier to isolate</li><li>You can use a subroutine without understanding how it works internally - helps to manage complexity of program</li><li>People can work on different subroutines at the same time - promotes modular development in teams</li><li>Once a subroutine is known to work correctly, it can be reused - less chance of introducing new bugs</li></ol>",,,3,1
Why is composition favoured over inheritance?,"<ul><li>Easier to test the class that is being used internally.</li><li>Can be unintended side effects if the base class is changed.</li><li>If a new class is developed, it's easier to change when using composition.</li></ul>",,,2,1
What are the advantages of using local variables over global variables?,"<ol><li>Only accessible within a single subroutine - other parts of program can't change them by mistake, reducing bugs caused by unexpected variable changes</li><li>Only exist during the execution of the subroutine - saves memory as they are removed after the routine ends</li><li>Variables are only relevant in a small scope - no worries about interactions with other parts of the program</li><li>Prevents clashes with variable names used elsewhere in the program</li></ol>",,,2,0
How do you convert a string to a date in python?,"Use the datetime module.<br>dt = datetime.strptime(""2025-4-15"", ""%Y-%m-%d"")<br>strptime(string, format) is the method you need.<br>",,,3,3
"How would you extract ""brown"" from the string ""quick brown fox""?","Use slice operator [a:b]<br>string[6:11] => ""brown""<br>a is included, b is not included",,,3,1
What are the different formatting options in the datetime module?,<ul><li>%a = day of week</li><li>%d = date of month</li><li>%m = month number</li><li>%Y = year</li><li>%S = second</li><li>%M = minute</li><li>%H = hour</li></ul>,,,3,1
What are the properties of a recursive function?,<ul><li>A function that calls itself.</li><li>Returns a 'base case' once a condition is met.</li><li>Terminates in a finite amount of time.</li>,,,0,0
