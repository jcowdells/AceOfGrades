What is ultimate tensile strength?,"The maximum stress that a material can withstand before it begins to break. Some material may break at their UTC, some may start to fracture and weaken, breaking at a higher strain.",,,4,3
What is the Young Modulus of a material?,"It is the ratio between stress and strain within the limit of proportionality for an object. It has the same units as stress, as strain is unitless.",,,4,4
What is hysteresis?,Hysteresis is the thermal energy lost during the compression of a spring. It is caused by the frictional forces between polymer chains in the material.,,,4,2
What does the area under a stress-strain graph represent?,The area under a stress-strain graph is the energy stored per unit volume of a material.,,,4,4
What are tensile and compressive forces?,A tensile force is a pair of forces that cause an extension on an object. A compressive force is a pair of forces that cause an object to shorten / compress.,,,4,2
What is Hooke's law?,"The extension of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied, so long as the elastic limit of the spring is not exceeded.",,,4,4
What does the spring constant (k) tell you about a material?,The stiffness.,,,4,2
What experiment can you use to determine the spring constant of a material?,"<ul><li>Using the equation F = kx, force = spring constant * extension</li><li>Attach a spring to a bench with a g-clamp, and measure its initial extension.</li><li>Add a mass to the spring, and measure the new extension.</li><li>Repeat this until you have at least 6 data points for masses.</li><li>You can find the weight of each mass using W = mg.</li><li>Plot a graph of force on the y axis, and extension on the x axis.</li><li>The gradient of this graph should be the spring constant.</li></ul>",,,4,4
How can you tell if a material has been deformed from its force-extension graph?,"If the loading and unloading curves meet at the origin, then all of the inputted energy has left the system. If the unloading curve does not go back to the origin, some of the energy has been lost by deforming the object.",,,4,2
How can you determine the Young Modulus of a metal wire?,"<ul><li>Get a long piece of metal wire, around 2-3 meters.</li><li>Use a micrometer to measure the diameter in several places along the wire, and take an average.</li><li>r = d / 2, area = pi * r * r.</li><li>Attach one end to a clamp, and another end to a pulley.</li><li>Place a meter rule beneath the wire.</li><li>Attach a marker onto the wire, and record the length of the wire up to the marker.</li><li>Attach a mass to the end of the wire at the pulley end, to apply a force along the wire.</li><Measure the new position of the marker, and calculate the extension of the wire.</li><li>Repeat with increasing masses, to gather at least 6 pieces of data.</li><li>Calculate the stress and strain for each data point, using the data you collected.</li><li>Plot a graph of stress over strain, and the gradient will be the young modulus.</li></ul>",,,4,4
What is a polymeric material?,"A polymeric material is one that consists of polymer chains, such as rubber and polythene.",,,4,4
"What is a brittle material, and what is a ductile material?","A brittle material only has an elastic region, it will break at the elastic limit. A ductile material will not break at the elastic material, it will undergo ""necking"" which causes it to stretch in the middle before breaking fully.",,,4,4
What is tensile strain?,Tensile strain is the ratio between the extension and original length of an object. ε = x / L (unitless),,,4,4
"What does it mean for a material to be elastic, and what does it mean to be plastic?",An elastic material is one that can stretch and still return to its original shape once the force is removed. A plastic material can be permanently deformed by a force if it reaches its elastic limit.,,,4,3
What is tensile stress?,Tensile stress is the force applied per unit of cross-sectional area on a spring. σ = F / A,,,4,4
What is a yield point on a stress-strain graph?,A yield point is a point of rapid extension.,,,4,4
