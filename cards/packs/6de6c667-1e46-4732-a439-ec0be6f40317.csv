How does an IV characteristic of a resistor look? What does this tell us about resistors?,"<ul><li>Creates a straight line graph passing through the origin.</li><li>Resistors are non-polar, and ohmic.</li></ul>",,,2,1
"In terms of number density, how are light levels and resistance linked for an LDR?","<ul><li>At a low light level, the LDR will have a low number density, meaning it has a high resistance.</li><li>As light level increases, the number density will increase, reducing the resistance.</li></ul>",,,2,2
What is the difference between resistance and resistivity?,Resistance is a measure of how difficult it is for current to flow through a component.<br>Resistivity is a measure of how difficult it is for current to flow through a material.,,,2,1
What is the difference between a cell and a battery?,A cell is a source of E.M.F using chemical energy. A battery is several (2 or more) cells connected in series.,,,1,0
Explain the shape of the IV graph for a filament lamp.,"<ul><li>At low voltages, the current is low due to Ohm's law.</li><li>As voltage increases, so does current, leading to heating of the filament.</li><li>As the filament heats up, the ions in the metal lattice vibrate more.</li><li>This leads to increased resistance, as the number of electrons colliding with the ions increases.</li><li>As resistance increases, the current will be reduced for a given voltage, leading to a flattening curve.</li></ul>",,,2,2
What are the three rules for drawing circuit diagrams?,<ul><li>Draw straight lines with a ruler.</li><li>Make sure that wires do not have gaps in.</li><li>Use the correct circuit symbols.</li></ul>,,,2,1
What is Ohm's Law?,"Ohm's Law states that the potential difference across an Ohmic conductor is directly proportional to the current through it, so long as the temperature remains constant.",,,2,1
What material are LDRs and thermistors made from?,Semiconductors whose number density can be easily changed by external factors.,,,2,2
What practical can be carried out to determine the resistivity of a material?,"<ul><li>Measure the diameter of a stretch of wire using a micrometer in several places, and take the mean. pi * (half diameter)^2 = area of wire.</li><li>Connect a voltmeter in series across two crocodile clips, which are connected to two ends of a cell.</li><li>Connect an ammeter in series before one of the crocodile clips.</li><li>Place a meter rule beneath the wire.</li><li>Use crocodile clips to vary the length of wire that has current flowing through it, starting at a length of 10cm and increasing in 10cm intervals.</li><li>Calculate resistance in wire at each step using V = IR.</li><li>Plot a graph of resistance against length.</li><li>As R = pL/A, gradient = p/A, so gradient * Area = resistivity.</li></ul>",,,2,0
How does an IV characteristic for a filament lamp look? What can we deduce about lamps from this?,"<ul><li>A line passing through origin, with decreasing gradient. Resembles a cube root graph.</li><li>Lamp is non-polar and non-ohmic.</li></ul>",,,2,2
Does a thermistor have a positive or negative temperature coefficient?,"It has a negative coefficient - as the temperature increases, the resistance decreases.",,,2,2
Which three factors affect the resistance of a wire?,<ul><li>The length.</li><li>The cross-sectional area.</li><li>The material.</li></ul>,,,2,2
How does an IV characteristic for a diode look? What does this tell us about diodes?,"<ul><li>A flat line for negative voltages, and an increasing gradient for positive voltages, past the threshold p.d.</li><li>This tells us that diodes are polar and non-ohmic.</li></ul>",,,2,2
What is electromotive force?,Electromotive force is the energy supplied per unit charge passing through a source.,,,2,1
What is an electron gun?<br>How does it work?,"An electron gun is a device used to produce a beam of electrons.<br>It works by providing an alternating current through a heater, which releases electrons through thermionic emission. The electrons are released between a cathode (Wehnelt cylinder) and anode, which have a large potential difference. The electrons are accelerated towards the anode, which has a small hole in to create a small beam of accelerated electrons. The whole process happens inside an evacuated glass tube to prevent electrons colliding with air particles.",,,2,1
How can you investigate the effect of temperature on a thermistor?,"<ul><li>Place thermistor inside a water bath.</li><li>Use ohmmeter to measure the resistance.</li><li>Create a table of temperature and resistance.</li><li>Vary temperature of water bath, and record how resistance changes.</li><li>Plot a graph of temperature against resistance.</li></ul>",,,1,1
Why does the resistance of a wire increase as it gets hotter?,"<ul><li>As the wire gets hotter, the metal ions in the lattice gain more kinetic energy, and vibrate more.</li><li>These increased vibrations cause more frequent collisions between free (conduction) electrons and the lattice ions.</li><li>This means that it is more difficult for electrons to move through the wire.</li><li>This leads to a reduced current for the same potential difference, increasing the resistance.</li></ul>",,,2,2
How should a voltmeter be used?<br>What property does an ideal voltmeter have and why?,"A voltmeter should be connected in parallel across the component being measured. An ideal voltmeter would have an infinite resistance, so that no current flows through it, meaning it has no effect on the component being measured.",,,2,2
What is the definition of resistivity?,Resistivity is a fundamental property of a material that describes how strongly it resists the flow of electric current.,,,2,1
What is the IV characteristic of a thermistor? What properties does this tell us?,"<ul><li>Line passing through origin, increasing gradient as voltage increases. Resembles a cube graph.</li><li>Non-ohmic, and non-polar.</li></ul>",,,2,2
What is the definition of potential difference?,The work done per unit charge to move a charge between two points in a circuit.,,,2,0
What is resistance?,Resistance is defined as the ratio between the potential difference across a component and the current passing through it.,,,2,1
