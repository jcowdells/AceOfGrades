What is a check digit?,"A check digit is a digit placed at the end of a long number such as a PESEL. Checking the number often involves modulo operations, so that the number mod x = 0, indicating that the number is valid.",,,1,1
What kinds of things can be included in image metadata?,<ul><li>Date or time</li><li>Exposure / aperture</li><li>Thumbnail</li><li>Copyright information</li></ul>,,,2,2
What is the Nyquist Theorem?,A sufficiently accurate waveform of an analogue signal would require a sampling rate of at least twice the highest frequency that appears in the original analogue signal.,,,2,2
What are 'Parity Bits'?,"A method for checking binary data for errors during transmission by counting the number of ones and zeroes present, and checking if it is even or odd.",,,2,1
What makes a caesar cipher insecure?,"<ul><li>Each plaintext letter is converted to the same ciphertext letter</li><li>Frequency analysis can be used to determine original message</li><li>There are only 26 mappings for the cipher, brute force attack is trivial</li></ul>",,,2,1
What is MIDI?,Musical Instrument Digital Interface,,,2,2
What makes a vernam cipher 'perfectly secure'?,"<ul><li>The ciphertext contains no useful information about the plaintext</li><li>Each letter can be mapped differently each time in the ciphertext</li><li>Brute force will only reveal every possible plaintext</li><li>All ciphertext letters have equal probability, so frequency analysis does not work</li></ul>",,,2,1
What are some properties an svg object can have?,<ul><li>Object type</li><li>Fill colour</li><li>Edge colour</li><li><b>NOT JUST COLOUR</b></li><li>Line width</li><li>Line pattern</li><li>Fill pattern</li></ul>,,,2,2
What is Unicode? Why was it created?,"Unicode was created as another way of encoding characters. It comes in forms such as UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32, with the number denoting the number of bits per character. Unicode was created to replace ASCII, which only has 95 symbols, as it allows other languages to be represented. Unicode allows for many billions of characters to be supported, allowing foreign languages such as Mandarin and Japanese.",,,1,1
What are some examples of analogue and digital signals?,Analogue Signals:<ul><li>Sound Waves</li><li>Radio Waves</li><li>Thermometer Readings</li><li>Vinyl Records</li><li>Film Camera</li><li>WiFi - uses Radio Waves</li></ul>Digital Signals:<ul><li>MP3 Sound Files</li><li>Digital Clock</li><li>Digital Camera</li><li>Fibre Optic Cables</li></ul>,,,2,1
What is a Caesar Cipher?,A substitution cipher where each character of text is shifted by a fixed number of characters up the alphabet.,,,2,2
What is majority voting?,Majority voting is when each bit is transmitted an odd number of times (usually 3) and then the most common bit is used as the value of that bit. An odd number is used as otherwise the real bit can still be ambiguous.,,,1,1
What is a Vernam Cipher?,"A cipher that uses a one-time pad with the same length as the message. A one time pad should be:- never re-used- disposed of securely- be truly random- transferred securely, independently of the messageEach character is XORed with the corresponding character in the one-time pad. Then, you can XOR the ciphertext with the one-time pad to get back the plaintext.",,,2,2
What are the advantages and disadvantages of vector graphics?,"Advantages:- less storage space- can be scaled without distortion- can manipulate individual objects in an imageDisadvantages:- Only useful for images made of geometric shapes- Unsuitable if each pixel needs to be a different colour, e.g in photographs- Can take longer to render for complex images",,,2,2
What are the advantages of using majority voting over parity bits?,"<ul><li>Parity bits can only identify errors, whereas majority voting can both identify and correct errors.</li><li>Majority voting can detect multiple bit errors, whereas parity bits only detect errors within a byte.</li><li>Majority voting is more likely to catch errors, as if an even number of errors occur within a byte, the parity bits will not detect it.</li></ul>",,,1,1
What is ASCII? What does it mean and how does it work?,"It is the ""American Standard Code for Information Exchange"". It uses 7 bits to represent the most common characters in the English language. The first 32 codes, plus the last code are used as control characters.",,,1,1
What is the definition of a pixel?,A pixel is a 'picture element'. It is the smallest addressable element of a picture.,,,2,2
What is encryption?,The process of converting data (plaintext) into a form which cannot be understood (ciphertext) using an encryption algorithm (cipher). The ciphertext can be decrypted using a key and understood by the intended recipient.,,,2,2
What is the difference between lossy and lossless compression?,"Lossless compression retains all of the data in the original file, by rearranging and storing the data in a more efficient way.Lossy compression removes data that is deemed unnecessary in order to reduce the file size, meaning the original file cannot be reconstructed.",,,2,2
What is a checksum?,"A checksum is a value calculated via an algorithm from the data in a file, and is usually appended to the end of the file. If the receiver re calculates the checksum, and they do not match, then an error has occurred during transmission.",,,1,1
What is metadata?,Data about data - stores properties and extra information outside of the main intention of the file.,,,2,2
What is run-length encoding?,"A type of lossless compression where repeated occurrences of the same data (like several pixels of the same color) are stored as a single data value, along with a count of occurrences.",,,2,2
How do you convert from analogue to digital and vice versa?,"<ul><li>Use an analogue to digital converter (ADC) to convert continuous analogue signals into digital.</li><li>Use a digital to analogue converter (DAC) to convert digital signals into continuous analogue signals, by guesstimating between digital values.</li></ul>",,,2,2
What is a 'check digit'?,A method of checking codes for errors during data transmission by adding an extra digit to the end (usually calculated/processed from the digits in the data itself) that checks whether the data is accurate.,,,2,1
What is 'Majority Voting'?,"A method of checking binary data for errors by sending each bit multiple times, in a set. The receiver takes the value with the most occurrences in a set as the value for that bit.",,,2,2
What are parity bits?,"Parity bits are based on the principle that every byte or other chunk of data should have either an odd (odd parity) or even (even parity) number of 1s in the bit pattern. The parity bit is set based on the number of 1s in the data. If the number of 1s is found to be odd, with an even parity, then you know that something fucked up.",,,1,1
What is dictionary-based coding?,A type of lossless compression where text is searched for entries that match the entries in a dictionary. Entries are substituted by a code which can be translated.,,,2,2
How does an ADC (analog-digital converter) work?,<ul><li>The ADC takes samples of the analog SIGNAL at regular intervals.</li><li>The amplitude of each SAMPLE is measured.</li><li>Each SAMPLE is encoded as a binary value.</li></ul>,,,0,0
How does a DAC (digital to analog converter) work?,<ul><li>The DAC receives a signal made of discrete binary numbers.</li><li>The DAC interpolates between each discrete value of the input signal over the amount of time between values.</li><li>The DAC uses this to produce a continuous analog output signal.</li></ul>,,,0,0
