After same patience.,"... deserves that same patience.<br>Because if we do get fusion working. If we can master the power that fuels the stars<br>We would have clean, limitless energy source for generations.<br>Imagine the impact that would have, affordable electricity for every country, no dependence on fossil fuels, no carbon emissions.",,,4,3
After instincts.,"... not logical. lets look at what nuclear is<br>Nuclear energy works by harvesting energy from atoms.<br>An atom can be thought of as a nucleus with orbiting electrons.<br>Made of protons and neutrons, held together by the strong nuclear force - one of four fundamental forces in the universe.",,,4,3
After releases enormous energy.,"... releases an enormous amount of energy.<br>Whats so exciting about fusion is that it fixes almost every problem fission has.<br>There's no long lived nuclear waste. There's no risk of meltdown. Its powered by hydrogen which is much more abundant than uranium or plutonium. And if something goes wrong, the reaction just stops.",,,4,1
After nuclear bound to cause destruction.,"... all things nuclear bound to cause destruction.<br>However, this is simply not the case.<br>The technology that failed in 1986 isn't the technology that we use today.<br>We don't judge the safety of modern cars by looking at ones from the 1940s.<br>In fact, the Chernobyl design wouldn't even be legal now.<br>The systems we use today are built with redundancy on top of redundancy - automatic shutdowns, passive cooling, containment domes.<br>And they've been running safely in many countries for decades.",,,4,1
After riskier than alternative.,"... is it riskier than the alternative?<br>Every year, burning fossil fuels kills millions through air pollution and contributes massively to climate change.<br>Yet that's invisible, its spread out, and somehow easier to ignore.",,,4,3
After human perception.,"... car accidents.<br>And when it comes to nuclear, we always focus on the worst possible scenario.<br>Meltdown, radiation, catastrophe.<br>Ignore the average case.<br>Clean, zero carbon energy source thats been running for decades.",,,4,3
Opening.,"If I were to say the word ""nuclear""<br>First thing that comes to mind<br>Glowing green sludge, radiation poisoning, explosions, barren post-apocalyptic wasteland.<br>",,,4,4
"After ""splitting the atom"".","... hence ""splitting the atom"".<br>This process is known as fission, and is the basis of how a nuclear power plant operates.<br>The released energy is used to boil water and create steam, which goes on to spin a turbine and produce electricity.",,,4,4
After what atom is.,"... fundamental forces of the universe.<br>For smaller atoms such as hydrogen or helium, this force is incredibly stable.<br>However, for larger atoms the force is no longer strong enough to hold the atom together.<br>A tiny nudge can be enough to unsettle the nucleus and cause it to split in half, releasing some of the stored energy, hence ""splitting the atom"".",,,4,4
After greener future.,"... towards a greener future.<br>Because while we keep improving renewables like solar and wind, we still need something stable that doesn't depend on the weather.<br>Nuclear fission fills that role beautifully until the next chapter of nuclear energy arrives.<br>And that next chapter is fusion.",,,4,4
After opening question.,"... barren, post-apocalyptic wasteland.<br>Most people perceive the concept of anything ""nuclear"" as inherently dangerous.<br>However, humans tend to be naturally bad at ranking danger.<br>Worry about Shark attacks > heart disease.<br>Worry about Plane crashes > car accidents.<br>",,,4,4
After running safely.,"... running safely in many countries for decades.<br>So the question isn't ""is nuclear energy risky?""<br>It's ""is it riskier than the alternative?""",,,4,2
After people dismiss it.,"... people dismiss it.<br>And this is where the perception becomes dangerous.<br>By being afraid of a rare, immediate risk, we may be accepting a guaranteed, long term one.<br>Climate change, air pollution and energy scarcity.",,,4,2
After not left behind.,"... shouldnt be left behind.<br>Every technology started with a messy prototype.<br>Steam engines exploded, early cars caught fire, the first computers took up entire rooms and crashed constantly.<br>But we didn't give up on them, we improved them, and I think that nuclear energy deserves that same patience.",,,4,1
After easier to ignore.,"... somehow easier to ignore.<br>Nuclear energy, by contrast, has one of the lowest death rates per unit electricity of any energy source.<br>Even lower than solar and wind if including material production and construction.<br>But because it feels scarier, people dismiss it.",,,4,1
After produce electricity.,"... produce electricity.<br>Nuclear power plants contain control rods, when activated they can precisely control the rate of nuclear reaction or stop it completely if needed.<br>",,,4,3
After nuclear reality.,"... keeping the lights on for decades.<br>Statistically speaking, the damage done by burning fossil fuels is significantly worse than from nuclear energy.<br>Estimated that fossil fuel emissions lead to 5.13 million excess deaths per year.<br>In contrast, nuclear power has led to exactly 0 excess deaths in the past decade.",,,4,3
After energy scarcity.,"... energy scarcity.<br>Nuclear fission isn't perfect. It produces nuclear waste, it's complex to manage, and it's not exactly cheap to build a new power plant.<br>But I see it as a stepping stone, a necessary one, towards a greener future.",,,4,2
After fusion.,"... next chapter is fusion.<br>Fusion is the process that powers the sun.<br>Instead of splitting heavier atoms, it combines lighter ones<br>Usually isotopes of hydrogen into helium.<br>And in the process, it releases an enormous amount of energy.",,,4,4
After within our lifetime.,"...predicting within our lifetime.<br>Nuclear power had a rough start.<br>It was born in wartime, mishandled in the early days, and misunderstood ever since.<br>But that doesn't mean it should be left behind.",,,4,4
After no dependence.,"... no dependence on fossil fuels.<br>And maybe then, the word nuclear will stop meaning danger and start meaning hope.",,,4,2
After statistics.,"... zero excess deaths in the past decade.<br>Yet our instincts still tell us that nuclear energy must be more dangerous because of the potential hazards.<br>That instinct is understandable, but it is not logical.<br>So lets look at what nuclear energy actually is.<br>",,,4,1
After materials like nowhere else.,"... withstand conditions not found anywhere else.<br>But progress is being made faster than ever before.<br>Projects like ITER in France, and companies using methods like laser ignition and magnetic confinement.<br>Have all made major breakthroughs in the last few years, some predicting net positive energy (more in than out) in our lifetime.",,,4,3
After synonymous with nuclear.,"... became much more synonymous with the word nuclear.<br>This perception was worsened by accidents such as the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.<br>Poor quality reactor, old technology, lack of safety culture.<br>Further fueling people's perception that all things nuclear are bound to cause destruction.",,,4,3
After control rod.,"... stop reaction if needed.<br>The process of nuclear fission was first documented in 1938, when scientists discovered that splitting a uranium atom produces a huge amount of energy.<br>Having access to such a huge amount of energy opened the door to two possibilities. One of almost limitless electricity, the other to making weapons of mass destruction, with the latter becoming much more synonymous with the word nuclear.",,,4,4
After the reaction just stops.,"... the reaction just stops.<br>The challenge is making it happen on Earth.<br>Temperatures 150 million celsius, strong magnetic fields to contain plasma. And materials to withstand conditions found nowhere else in the universe.",,,4,4
