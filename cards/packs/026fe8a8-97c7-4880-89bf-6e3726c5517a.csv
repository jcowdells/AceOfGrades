What is the fast way to traverse a tree by hand?,"Draw a dot on each node, left = pre-order, bottom = in-order, right = post-order. Then draw a line anti-clockwise around the tree. The order that this line hits the dots is the traversal order.",,,3,3
What is a data structure?,"A data structure is a way to store, organise and manage data in a way that makes it easier and more efficient to process for a program.",,,3,0
What is a root node?,The only node in a rooted tree which has no parent.,,,3,3
What is a hash table?,A hash table is a data structure that stores items at positions calculated by a hashing algorithm. The algorithm can be reapplied to a key to retrieve the stored data.,,,3,3
What is a binary tree?,"A rooted tree where each node has, at most, two children.",,,3,3
When would an adjacency list be used over an adjacency matrix?,"An adjacency list uses much less memory than a matrix for sparse graphs, as the lack of an edge is simply not stored. They are also much faster at adding new nodes. Adjacency lists are good when the graph is large, sparse, or needs to be updated frequently.",,,3,3
What are the types of binary tree traversals?,<ul><li>Pre order traversal: self -> left -> right</li><li>In order traversal: left -> self -> right</li><li>Post order traversal: left -> right -> self</li></ul>,,,3,3
How can a tree be implemented?,"As a tree is a subset of graphs, it can be implemented using an adjacency list or adjacency matrix. Alternatively, it can be stored as a list/array of data, left index and right index.",,,3,3
What is a priority queue?,A priority queue will have a value attached to each item in the queue. The item with the lowest number (highest priority) will be dequeued first.,,,3,3
What is the difference between a static and a dynamic data structure?,"A static data structure has a predetermined size, and cannot grow in size if more data arrives. However, a dynamic data structure can grow and shrink as needed, as it dynamically allocates memory.",,,3,3
What is a dictionary?,"An abstract data type that stores an unordered set of key–value pairs. Values are stored and retrieved by key, not by position.",,,3,2
What is a graph?,A non-linear data structure that comprises a set of connected nodes.,,,3,1
What are the advantages and disadvantages of dynamic data structures?,"Advantages:<br><ul><li>Efficient memory usage, only as much as really needed</li><li>Can adapt to size changes / can grow</li></ul>Disadvantages:<br><ul><li>Potentially slower access for some structures like linked lists.</li><li>More complex, requires careful memory management</li><li>More overhead, may require extra pointers to be stored etc.</li></ul>",,,3,2
What is the heap?,A pool of memory that is allocated to service dynamic data structures,,,3,3
What is Dijkstra's algorithm?,"It is an algorithm to discover the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It can be used in areas such as satellite navigation, routers etc.",,,3,3
What is a rooted tree?,A tree in which one node has been designated as the root.,,,3,3
What is the difference between an array and a list?,"An array has a fixed size, and each element must be of the same data type. They are a contiguous block of memory, making them fast to access. A list is a more abstract way of storing sequential data - it can store multiple types and grow in size. If implemented as a linked list, it can be slower to access.",,,3,3
What are the advantages and disadvantages of static data structures?,"Advantages:<br><ul><li>Potentially faster access to data compared to some dynamic structures</li><li>Easier to program / implement</li><li>Predictable memory access, only one allocation</li></ul>Disadvantages:<br><ul><li>The amount of space needed must be already known</li><li>High possibility of wasting memory</li><li>Difficult to resize if becomes full</li></ul>",,,3,3
In which scenarios would an adjacency matrix be used over an adjacency list?,"Adjacency matrices are more efficient when the presence of an edge needs to be checked frequently. They become much more optimal when the graph is dense (each node has a lot of edges), or speed is very important.",,,3,3
What is a tree?,"A connected, undirected graph with no cycles.",,,3,3
Where are trees used in computer science?,<ul><li>Binary expression trees to represent mathematical / boolean expressions.</li><li>In compilers to build syntax trees</li><li>Binary search trees to speed up searching</li></ul>,,,3,1
What are the two types of graph traversal? What is the same and what is different about them?,"The two types of graph traversals are breadth-first and depth-first. Both work in a similar way - nodes can be either unvisited, visited or discovered. As you go, add unvisited nodes to a visited storage. Then go back through each visited node in storage, mark discovered, and add visit unvisited neighbours at that node. The difference is that breadth first uses a queue, while depth-first uses a stack.",,,3,3
What is the difference between a linear queue and a circular queue?,"Both queues will have a enqueue and dequeue pointer, which are incremented when pushing and popping respectively. However, a linear queue becomes full when the enqueue pointer reaches the end of the list. A circular queue can wrap the enqueue pointer around to the front of the list to reuse memory if there has been a dequeue that has freed up space.",,,3,3
