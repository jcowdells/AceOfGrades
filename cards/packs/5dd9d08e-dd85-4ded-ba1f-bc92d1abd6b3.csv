What is terminal p.d? What are lost volts?,Terminal p.d. is the potential difference across a cell after some of the e.m.f. is lost due to internal resistance. Lost volts are the difference between a cell's e.m.f. and its terminal p.d.,,,4,4
What is the purpose of a potential divider circuit?,"To divide the potential difference into smaller, more usable fractions.",,,4,4
What is the potential divider equation?,Vout = (R2 * Vin) / (R1 + R2),,,4,4
How can a sensing circuit be created using a potential divider?,"By using a potential divider circuit, and replacing one of the resistors with a sensing resistor (e.g. thermistor or LDR), the changing resistance will change the output p.d. on both resistors, which can be used to power different components.",,,4,4
How is e.m.f divided between components in series versus in parallel?,"In series, each component gets a share of the e.m.f that corresponds to its resistance. In parallel, each closed loop receives the same e.m.f as the source gives, but within each loop this e.m.f is shared between components in it.",,,4,4
How can the internal resistance of a cell be determined experimentally?,"<ul><li>Construct a circuit containing a cell and a variable resistor.</li><li>Place an ammeter in series, and a voltmeter in parallel across the cell.</li><li>Starting at the smallest resistance, adjust the variable resistor in small increments, e.g. 10 ohms.</li><li>Plot a graph of V against I.</li><li>ε = V + Ir</li><li>V = -Ir + ε</li><li>y = mx + c</li><li>So the gradient is -internal resistance, the y-intercept is the e.m.f</li></ul>",,,4,1
What is Kirchhoff's second law?,"For every closed loop in a circuit, the sum of e.m.fs in that loop will equal the sum of p.ds in that loop.",,,4,4
What is the definition of internal resistance?,The opposition to the flow of charge within the source of e.m.f.,,,4,2
What is Kirchhoff's second law a consequence of and why?,"Kirchhoff's second law is a natural consequence of the conservation of energy. The total energy given to each unit of charge must be transferred out of the circuit, else energy has been lost.",,,4,3
What is Kirchhoff's first law?,The sum of currents flowing into a junction always equals the sum of currents flowing out of that junction.,,,4,3
Why do cells have an internal resistance?,"The materials that make up the cell (e.g. metals) naturally resist the flow of charge somewhat, causing a resistance within the cell.",,,4,3
What are the two e.m.f. / internal resistance equations?,<ol><li>ε = I(R + r)</li><li>ε = V + Ir</li></ol>,,,4,4
