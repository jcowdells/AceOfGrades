What is the function of a capacitor?,"A capacitor's purpose is to store charge, it does so by keeping charge separated.",,,0,0
How is a basic capacitor made?,"A basic ""parallel plate"" capacitor is made by placing two metal plates parallel to each other with a gap in between. This allows charge to build up on the plates but stops it from crossing between the plates.",,,0,0
What is a dielectric?,"A dielectric is a material that is placed between the plates of a capacitor. It is an insulator which has a low permittivity, meaning that a larger amount of charge can be stored on either plate.",,,0,0
How does the charge on either plate of a capacitor compare to each other?,"The magnitude of the charge on each plate will be the same, although one plate will be positive and one will be negative.",,,0,0
How is total capacitance calculated for capacitors in parallel?,The total capacitance = The sum of each capacitor's capacitance.,,,0,0
How is total capacitance calculated for capacitors in series?,Total capacitance = 1 / (sum of (1 / capacitances)),,,0,0
How does the charge on each capacitor in parallel look?,"In parallel, each capacitor stores a charge that is proportional to it's capacitance, as each capacitor is receiving the same p.d.",,,0,0
How does the charge for each capacitor look in series?,"In series, each capacitor has an equal charge stored, as it begins to act as a single (rubbish) capacitor.",,,0,0
How can you determine the energy stored in a capacitor graphically?,Draw a graph of p.d. on y-axis and charge on x-axis. The area underneath this graph will give you the stored energy = QV/2,,,0,0
What are the three equations for energy stored on a capacitor?,<ul><li>W = ½QV</li><li>W = ½V²C</li><li>W = ½Q²/C</li></ul>,,,0,0
"How does the graph of charging a capacitor look like for charge, current and potential difference?","All three discharging graphs follow a similar shape of X = X0 * e^-t/CR, in other words they are exponential decay graphs.",,,0,0
What is the time constant of a capacitor and what does it represent?,"The time constant (τ) of a capacitor is determined by the capacitance * discharging resistance = CR. The time constant represents the time taken for the charge, current or voltage of the capacitor to reduce to 1/e of its original value ≈ 0.37 * original.",,,0,0
"How do the graphs of charge, current and potential difference look when charging a capacitor?","<ul><li>The current has an exponential decay relationship.</li><li>The charge and potential difference have a shape similar to 1 - e^-x, so starting at 0 and increasing at a reducing rate until reaching a maximum</li></ul>",,,0,0
What variables affect the capacitance of a capacitor?,<ol><li>Distance between plates</li><li>Area of overlap between plates</li><li>Dielectric between the plates (ε)</li></ol>,,,0,0
What is the equation for capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor?,"C = εA/d (permittivity * overlap / separation), where ε = εᵣε₀ (relative permittivity of dielectric * permittivity of free space)",,,0,0
What is the capacitance of an isolated charged sphere?,C = 4πε₀r,,,0,0
