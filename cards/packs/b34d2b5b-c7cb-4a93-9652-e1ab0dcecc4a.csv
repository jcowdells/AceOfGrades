What is an entity identifier?,"An entity identifier is the attribute or attributes of an entity that can be used to uniquely identify any entity in the relation. It can either be a primary key, or a composite primary key.",,,3,3
What is a data model?,A data model is an abstract model for organising data and its relationship to real world entities.,,,3,1
What is second normal form of a database?,"In second normal form, the database satisfies first normal form. Additionally, partial key dependencies are removed - the database is split so that the data is only dependent on the key. If you had an entity Student(StudentID, StudentName, StudentSubject, SubjectExamDate), then StudentExamDate is only dependent on StudentSubject, not on StudentID. Therefore Subject and ExamDate should be in their own table.",,,3,2
What makes a relational database different from a flat file database?,"A relational database has relations instead of tables. Each table represents a single entity, and relationships between entities are represented by foreign keys.",,,3,3
What is an attribute of an entity?,A characteristic specification that defines a property or feature about an entity stored in a database.,,,3,2
What is serialisation (for database concurrent access)?,The process of deciding which transactions can be run in parallel or not (serial = not parallel). This can be achieved by 'record locking' or by 'timestamp ordering'.,,,2,1
"How would you write the entity description for a Customer entity, with an ID, name, address and email?","Don't forget to underline primary key.<br>Customer(CustomerID, CustomerName, CustomerAddress, CustomerEmail)",,,4,4
What is a client server database?,A database that provides simultaneous access to the database for multiple clients.,,,2,1
What is the first normal form of a database?,"In first normal form, the database:<br><ul><li>Contains no repeating attributes</li><li>The stored data is atomic (cannot be split any further)</li></ul><br>For example, if a school database had ""Science, Maths"" as subjects listed for a teacher, this should be split into two different entries for each subject.",,,3,2
What is meant by concurrent access in a database system?,Allowing two or more users to access information from the database while retaining data integrity.,,,2,1
What is timestamp ordering?,"Timestamp ordering involves storing the last read and last write timestamps for each record. Any subsequent read requests must be newer than the last write, and any write requests must be newer than the last read request.",,,2,2
What is record locking?,Record locking is a technique to prevent simultaneous access to a database by locking a record while it is being updated.,,,2,2
What are entity relationship diagrams?,"Entity relationship diagrams are used to graphically represent the relationships between entities in a relational database. The possible relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many. They are represented by a straight line to symbol one, or by 3 lines to symbol many.",,,3,3
What is commitment ordering?,Commitment ordering is needed to allow record locking to work. It is a process that decides the most efficient order to apply transactions that will cause the least amount of record locks.,,,2,1
