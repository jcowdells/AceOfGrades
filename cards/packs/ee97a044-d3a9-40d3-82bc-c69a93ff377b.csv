What is Newton's first law?,"An object will remain at rest, or continue to move with a constant velocity, unless acted on by a resultant force.",,,0,0
What is Newton's second law?,"The resultant force is directly proportional to the rate of change of momentum, in some direction.",,,0,0
What is Newton's third law?,"For every force applied to object A by object B, there will be an equal but opposite force applied to object B by object A.",,,0,0
What are the characteristics of a pair of forces described by Newton's third law?,<ul><li>Acting with the same magnitude.</li><li>Acting in opposite directions.</li><li>Acting on different objects.</li><li>Acting as the same type of force.</li><li>Acting for the same period of time.</li></ul>,,,0,0
What is linear momentum?,Linear momentum is the product of an object's mass and linear velocity.,,,0,0
What is the definition of impulse?,Impulse is defined as the product of force and the duration of time that the force lasts for.,,,0,0
How does Newton's second law lead to the existence of impulse?,Force is rate of change of momentum.<br>F = Δp/Δt<br>FΔt = Δp = impulse,,,0,0
How can you find the impulse from a force-time graph?,"Impulse is the area beneath a force-time graph. You could find using calculations, counting squares, or trap rule.",,,0,0
What is the principle of the conservation of momentum?,"The total momentum in a closed system in any direction will always remain constant, as long as no external forces act on the system.",,,0,0
What are the different types of collisions?,<ul><li>Elastic collision - all kinetic energy is conserved.</li><li>Inelastic collision - some of the kinetic energy is lost.</li><li>Completely inelastic collision - the maximum amount of kinetic energy is lost (objects coalesce)</li><li>Superelastic collision - the kinetic energy increases due to external factors.</li></ul>,,,0,0
What are some facts that are true for all collisions?,<ul><li>Total momentum is the same before and after.</li><li>The magnitude of the impulse / force applied to each object is the same.</li><li>The total energy in the system is conserved (when including all forms of energy).</li></ul>,,,0,0
How do you work out the result of collisions in 2D?,"<ul><li>Resolve for momentum in x and y axes.<li><li>Momentum is conserved in all directions, so you can equate momentum in both axes before and after the collision.</li><li>Then, solve for unknowns.</li></ul>",,,0,0
