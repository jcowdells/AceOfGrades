What is the halting problem? How was it demonstrated?,"The halting problem says that it is not possible to devise an algorithm which can determine, given a program and an input, whether that program will halt or continue forever *without running the program*.<br>To prove it, you suppose there is such an program that can determine if another program will halt or not.<br>Now, create a new program, run the original program and say ""if the program says it will halt, repeat forever, otherwise halt"" (so do the opposite of what it says).<br>Now, feed the program into itself, with itself as the input. There is no possible output - if the program would repeat forever, the program would halt and vice versa - paradox, hence there is no such program. Q.E.D.",,,1,1
